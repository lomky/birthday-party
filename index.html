            <h1>Hey Come Hang Out</h1>
            
            <p>Your friends Kyle and/or Kat are having a casual joint birthday hangout again, and if you're reading this you should join us!</p>

            <section>
                <h2>What?</h2>
                <p>Come to a bar with us! Have a beer, a snack, or just come hang out! We have a ton of friends in common and a general desire to overcome to ambient bleakness of our shared birth month. This is the second iteration of this party (the first being pre-covid 2020) and it was fun last time so we're gonna do it again.</p>

                <p><strong>... wait, isn't there a pandemic on?</strong> Yeah, but we're both vaccinated and boostered, and we presume you are by now too. Also, we're holding it at an outdoor beer garden which generally isn't crowded outside of baseball season. Kyle and Kate went on a scouting mission couple of Sunday afternoons ago; it wasn't crowded, there's a roof over most of the space, and we'll be surrounded by ample space heaters that should keep us comfortable in all but the most calamitous weather. (10 days out and <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/forecast/us/dc/washington/20002" target="_blank">the forecast</a> looks as good as we can get for mid-February; we'll update this webpage if that changes and we need to cancel.) If you're feeling unwell, please stay home, and we'll make an effort to catch up with you soon.</p>

                <h2>When?</h2> 
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Kyle+and+Kat%27s+Birthday+Hangout&details=Join+us+at+a+bar+and+have+a+beverage+or+three%21+Swing+by+whenever+for+however+long.&location=Dacha+Navy+Yard&dates=20230212T170000Z%2F20230212T210000Z" target="_blank">Sunday, February 12th, 2023</a>. 
                    We'll be there from noon to 4pm; you're welcome to swing by at any point, and stay for as little or as long as you wish. <em>Of course</em> that's a link to create a Google Calendar event.
                </p>
                <p><strong>... wait, isn't that Super Bowl Sunday?</strong> Yeah, but the game won't get started until after 6pm, and we'll be gone long beforehand. (Seriously. Kyle has plans to watch it elsewhere.)</p>

                    <a href="https://www.dachabeergarden.com/navy-yard/" target="_blank">Dacha in Navy Yard</a>.
                    
                    It's directly across the street from the south side of Nationals Park, and a lazy ten minute walk from

                    of the Navy Yard-Ballpark metro station on the Green line. Street parking should be available within a few blocks, especially north of M Street SW.
                </p>

                <p><strong>... wait, not the Shaw location?</strong> Nope. The Shaw location of this beer garden is lovely for people watching, but it's smaller and far more popular/crowded. Don't go to Shaw, we won't be there.</p>

                <h2>Who?</h2> 
                <p>
                    You, your partners, and your good friends are all invited. No need to bother with RSVPs, apologies, or gifts.
                </p>

                <p><strong>... wait, is Kate coming?</strong> It's not like she has a choice.</p>
